README file for the SRC folder of the Mustard and Garlic Ear Infection Experiment

This folder contains the R script needed to create the plots and stats files as well as a text file containing sample code that can be directly copied in to create particular plots. 

To use the growth_curves.r script, first run source("path to r script") to load in the method. If it ran successfully, you should get a printed line telling you to run plotGrowth with all the inputs listed. Then, run plotGrowth with your desired inputs to output the growth curve plot and statistics text file.
